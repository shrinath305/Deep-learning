# Deep learning
This is my first code in deep learning. I have taken a data set(fictional) of a bank contains 10000 rows and 14 variable. Goal of this project is to create job demographich segmentation model to tell the bank which of their customer are at highest risk of leaving. Machine learning model is been modelled using artificial neural network. Using Keras library(in python) and H20 (In R) has been used to model building.
Though the output is  categoircal so, i used Sigmoid activation function  wherease for Hidden layer ReLu activation function.
